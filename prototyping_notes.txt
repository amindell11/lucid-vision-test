use Bayer8 RGB and binning on Triton to increase FPS (full resolution caps out the bandwidth)

exposure on helios can be set with ExposureTimeSelector, good estting is Exp250Us

make sure the range setting on helios is set properly (operating mode and distance Min/max) otherwise will give bad depth readings
